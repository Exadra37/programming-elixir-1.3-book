  # Pattern Matchingg Cannot Bind Keys

  While is possible to extract a value from a key during Pattern Matching,
  binding a value into a key of a Map will thrown a compile error.

  #### Example

  iex> CannotBindKeys.example
  :ok

  #%{ item => :ok } = %{ 1 => :ok, 2 => :error }
  Look for the above line in the code and uncomment it and recompile the code to see the error.
  :ok
  """
  def example() do
    %{ 1 => state } = %{ 1 => :ok, 2 => :error }
    IO.inspect state

    # this will throw the compile error, because we cannot assign `:ok` to
    # the key `item`.
    #%{ item => :ok } = %{ 1 => :ok, 2 => :error }
    IO.puts "\n#%{ item => :ok } = %{ 1 => :ok, 2 => :error }"
    IO.puts "Look for the above line in the code and uncomment it and recompile the code to see the error."
  end
